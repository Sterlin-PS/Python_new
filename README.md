# Peaky-Finders

This peak load forecasting application provides two resources for New York City building owners, facility managers, and residents interested in tomorrow's total electricity grid demand. The first model is a next-day hourly load curve for the NYISO. The second is a confidence interval representing the percent chance that tomorrow will be a peak load event. 

## Tech Stack

- Python 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask
- Dash 

## Data

To train the models, I used the PYISO
